This file defines a data source for querying data.

There are three parts to defining a data source:

* Defining column options via a Column class
* Defining table options via a DatasourceTable
* Defining the query mechanism via TableQuery

Note that you can define multiple Column and Table classes
in the same file, but only one TableQuery.  If you need
to define multiple types of queries, create multiple
files in this directory named accordingly.
